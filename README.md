The python codes are written with Python 3.x

The codes are for parsing and visualization of the local blast search results.

The blast softwares can be downloaded from the following NCBI database;

https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/


To use blast parsing code, the local blast output must be 'xml' format.

To see options;

"python3 0_blast_parsing___xml_format_v2.6.py3.py -help"


To use blast result visualization code, svgwirte must be installed.

To install svgwrite;

"pip install svgwrite"


The python code "0_BLAST_plot_identity_color_v1.1_py3.py" is for plotting blast results like dot plot.

The python code "0_BLAST_result_drawing_v2.0_py3.py" is for visualization of the blast results with various methods.

*Input file must be the csv file that is generated by the "0_blast_parsing___xml_format_v2.6.py3.py" with blast results.


To see options;

"python3 0_BLAST_plot_identity_color_v1.1_py3.py -help" 

"python3 0_BLAST_result_drawing_v2.0_py3.py -help"
